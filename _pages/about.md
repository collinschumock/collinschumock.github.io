Welcome---I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/).  I am also affiliated with Yale's [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/).  My research interests lie broadly in the areas of American political institutions, political economy, and special interest politics.  My research applies formal and quantitative methods to study these topics.

For academic year 2023--2024 I am a Graduate Student Advisor for the [Program on Ethics, Politics and Economics](https://epe.yale.edu/).
